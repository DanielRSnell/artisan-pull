To facilitate this, you may be given the option to sign, consent to, or agree to certain documents including, but not limited to, these Terms, policies, quotes, updates, notifications, or other information that you request, transaction receipts, documents requiring your signature, or any other documents ("Communications") electronically by either checking the appropriate box or engaging in a similar online process as instructed online. You agree that by checking the appropriate box within or adjacent to the applicable Communication or engaging in a similar online electronic consent process, you are providing your electronic signature and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions in such Communication just as if you had signed your name to a paper document.</p><h2>Payments and Payment Services</h2><section><p><strong>General Payment Terms.</strong> Read.cv may allow Users to pay for access to certain features, products, or services ("Purchases"). When you make a Purchase we may allow payments through a variety of different methods including but not limited to debit card, credit card, and other online payment methods. ("Payment Methods").  When you choose to make a Purchase, your Payment Method will be charged for the amount (and, if applicable, on the schedule) that was presented to you at the time of Purchase, plus any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on that payment. You hereby authorize us to charge your Payment Method for those Purchases. You understand and agree that, by signing up for a paid version of the Services (or by purchasing any other feature, product, or service that we may make available through the services), you will be authorizing Read.cv and our payment processor to collect, store, transfer, and charge your payment method on file for the agreed upon amount of that transaction. If your primary Payment Method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that we may use a secondary payment method in your account, if available. We reserve the right to revoke access to any feature, product, or service that you have purchased in the event that we are unable to charge your Payment Method for the Purchase that you made. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Read.cv.</p><p><strong>Subscriptions.</strong> Certain Read.cv features and functionality are only available to individuals who have Purchased a paid subscription ("Subscriptions"). Subscriptions will consist of a one-time charge, followed by recurring charges (typically monthly or yearly recurring charges) as disclosed to you at the time you Purchase the Subscription. By Purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that there is an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. You agree that we may submit periodic charges (monthly or otherwise, as disclosed) based on your elected subscription plan, without further authorization from you, until you provide notice (receipt of which is confirmed by us) that you have canceled your subscription, terminated this authorization, or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we reasonably could react to your notice. Your non-termination of a Subscription reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for the applicable Subscription fees. We may submit those charges for payment, and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected your Subscription (or as your payment terms may be amended thereafter). Finally, you understand that recurring Subscription prices may change in the future, provided that Read.cv will give you at least 30 days' notice of such change with the option to cancel future payments.</p><p><strong>Direct Billing.</strong> Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Company hereunder, company does not process payments for any services. To facilitate payment for the Services we use Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates ("Stripe"), a third-party payment processor. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe terms and conditions and other policies available at https://stripe.com/legal and Stripe's Global Privacy Policy available at: https://stripe.com/privacy (collectively, the "Stripe Agreements"). By agreeing to these Terms of Use, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Agreements, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. You hereby authorize Stripe to store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of the Service. Please contact Stripe for more information. Company assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service. You must provide and maintain a current, complete and accurate Payment Method. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any such Payment Method. By signing up for a Subscription, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for such Subscription in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your billing account upon demand. You authorize us to attempt repeat charges on your Payment Method if an initial attempt to charge fails.</p><p><strong>Promotions and Discounts.</strong> Read.cv may offer discounted Subscriptions or other discounts or promotions ("Promotions") from time to time, which may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar feature, product, or service. Any applicable sales and use taxes and services fees will be calculated based on the discounted Subscription value after the Promotion is applied. Certain Promotions may only be redeemed once you achieve a specified minimum fee threshold, and any sales or use taxes or service fees do not count towards achieving such threshold.

With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Company each hereby agree that each submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the Northern District of California.</p><h2>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</h2><p>Please read this section carefully as it affects your rights.</p><section><p><strong>a. Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Use as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Company, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><strong>b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</p><p><strong>c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</strong> Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@read.cv. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Company should be sent to New Layer, Inc. DBA Read.cv,  Attn: Legal ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Company and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.</p><p><strong>d. Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p><p><strong>e. Costs of Arbitration.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p><p><strong>f. Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p><p><strong>g. Severability.</strong> If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p><p><strong>h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p></section><h2>Termination</h2><p>You agree that Company, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including for lack of use or if Company believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Company may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Company may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Company will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p><h2>Notices</h2><p>Any notices or other communications provided by Read.cv under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p><h2>Waiver of Rights</h2><p>Read.cv's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Read.cv. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p><h2>Entire Terms</h2><p>Except as otherwise stated herein or otherwise amended and agreed to by you and Read.cv, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Read.cv and you regarding your use of the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Read.cv and you regarding the use of the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect - except as otherwise described in Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Read.cv's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will have no legal effect. Read.cv may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p><h2>Notice for California Users</h2><p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users of the Service from California are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted (a) via email at <a class="MegaLink_megalink__u_TFB" href="mailto:dca@dca.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hover="true">dca@dca.ca.gov</a>; (b) in writing at: Department of Consumer Affairs, Consumer Information Division, 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834; or (c) by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (800) 326-2297 (TDD).
