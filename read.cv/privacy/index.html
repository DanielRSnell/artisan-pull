Layer, Inc., doing business as Read.cv, provides a professional platform for teams and individuals to form beautiful profiles and make meaningful connections. This Privacy Policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>" or "<strong>Policy</strong>") explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our website located at read.cv (the "<strong>Site</strong>") and our communications with you (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). It also serves as a way to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.</p><h2>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2><p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll notify you of those changes by posting them within the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date above to indicate when those changes become effective.</p><h2>Scope of the Privacy Policy</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of our Services including without limitation, site visitors, registered user, and subscribers (all such users of the Services including account holders and non-account holders collectively referred to as "<strong>Users</strong>").</p><h2>Information That We Collect</h2><p>This section describes the different types of Personal Data we may obtain about you.</p><section><h3>Information that You Provide Directly</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Sign Up Information</strong>: When you sign up to create an account, including through the App, we collect and retain certain information that can be used to identify you ("<strong>Personal Data</strong>"), including, in the case of account creation: your name and email address (and in some cases your profile photo if you sign in via a third party sign-in service).</p></li><li><p><strong>Profile Information</strong>: When completing your profile you'll have the option to provide information about yourself which will be included in your public facing profile, including for instance: a profile photo, user name, screen name, interests, location, your websites, education, certifications, work experience, life experience, contact information, your publication, projects, exhibitions, and a short bio about you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Through Communicating with Us</strong>: You may provide information to us when you use the Services, including when you contact us, respond to surveys, or provide feedback about the Services. This information may include your name, email address, phone number, address, order payment information, and other information that may relate to you or identify you. We also collect any information you provide to us when you send us emails with queries, feedback, or for any other reason.</p></li><li><p><strong>Purchase and Payment Information</strong>: When you make payments for or within the Services, we will keep records of what you purchased or ordered, and will request financial information such as payment method or credit card information so we can charge you for your  purchase. We use a third-party payment processor to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third-party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Through Interactive Features</strong>: If you use any of our interactive features, such as messaging between Users, comment features, or social features, we will collect information that you might submit or make available. Information that you provide through public sharing features of the Services (which does not include one-to-one direct messages) will be treated as public information, except where contrary to applicable law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contact Information of Others</strong>: if you choose to share contact information of other individuals with us, for example if you are using a referral feature, we will collect and retain the contact information that you provide. Please only share the contact information of close friends and relations to you, or of others who have consented to such sharing of their information. </p></li><li><p><strong>Job Applications</strong>: We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications. We may also use this information to monitor recruitment statistics, to communicate with you, to comply with law, and as otherwise necessary for compliance, fraud prevention, and safety purposes.</p></li></ul><h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Information Sent by Your Device</strong>: We collect certain information that your mobile device, laptop, or other hardware device sends when you use our Services, including but not limited to IP Address, user agent information, network and connectivity information, device identifiers, language preferences, user settings, software and operating system names and versions, hardware models, as well as other information about your use of our Services.</p></li><li><p>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies: Like many website and app owners and operators, we (and our partners who assist us with marketing, analytics, User research, advertising, and User support) may utilize automated data collection tools such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags to collect certain information from Users of our Services.

Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner's or operator's privacy policy. We're not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.</p><h2>Processing Information in the United States</h2><p>We are headquartered in the United States and may use services providers that operate in other countries. Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. We strive to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws by taking reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no security measures are failsafe and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p><h2>Our Policy Toward Children</h2><p>Our Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 16. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data of a child under 16, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p><h2>Privacy Notice for California Residents</h2><p>If you are a California resident, you have certain additional privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). Those rights are all discussed in this Privacy Notice for California Residents section of our broader Privacy Policy.</p><section><h3>Your Rights Under the California Consumer Protection Act</h3><p>The following rights (in this section) are available  to California residents.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Right to request disclosure of information collected.</strong> You have the right to request details on the specific Personal Data we've collected about you during the past 12 months. We provide detailed information about the types of  information we collect throughout this broader Privacy Policy, but you may also contact us directly to inquire about your Personal Data specifically, as described in this Privacy Notice for California Residents section.</p></li><li><p><strong>Right to request disclosure of information shared or sold.</strong> First, we do not sell your Personal Data (or "personal information," as used in the CCPA) within the meaning of the CCPA. That said, we do share certain data about some of our Users with service providers. This sharing is outlined in this broader Privacy Policy, as well as below. And you do have the right under CCPA to contact us at any time, as described in the section below, to request this information from us.</p></li><li><p><strong>Right to opt out of selling of your Personal Data.</strong> As stated above, we do not sell your Personal Data, within the meaning of the CCPA. That said, in the event that we ever do choose to sell data to third parties, we will provide a method to allow our Users to opt out of that selling, in accordance with California law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Right to request deletion of data.</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your data, unless an exception applies. Examples of exceptions include when we need to keep data to meet legal obligations, detect fraud, investigate reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or fix security issues. Additionally, an exception would apply if we would be unable to provide the services that you signed up for without the data, in which case, you are free to request account deletion and cease use of the services. See more about this throughout the broader Privacy Policy. Once we've verified your request, we'll delete your Personal Data (unless an exception applies) and will direct our service providers to do the same.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timely response.</strong> You have the right to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We will respond to your request within 45 days, and in more difficult cases we may extend our response time by another 45 days.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-discrimination.</strong> You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. We will not discriminate against you because you exercise your rights. For example, we will not deny you any goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA.</p></li></ul><h3>Contacting Us (CCPA Purpose)</h3><p>To make any inquiries, request, or exercise any of your rights granted under California Consumer Protection Act, you can contact us by email at support@read.cv. Please state that you are a California resident in that communication. We may need to go through a few verification steps after you reach out, but we'll help you through that.</p><h3>Information We Collect (CCPA Required Disclosure)</h3><p>As we address throughout this Privacy Policy, we collect Personal Data for a range of purposes, though primarily to allow us to provide and improve our services.
